9.How to read and write a file using JavaScript?

Ans.Files can be read and written by using java script functions – fopen(),fread() and fwrite().
    The function fopen() takes two parameters – 
      1. Path and 2. Mode (0 for reading and 3 for writing). The fopen() function returns -1, if the file is successfully opened.

Example:

  file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0);

  [The function fread() is used for reading the file content.]


Example:
    str = fread(file,flength(file) ;

   [The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file.]
   


10.What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?

Ans. In JavaScript, there are three main types of looping structures that allow you to repeat

Example.
    1.for 
    2.while
    3.do while
    <script>
             1.FOR

        for (let i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {   
             document.write("Tops"+"<hr>")  
         }

            2. WHILE

             let i=0
         while (i<5) {
             document.write("TOPS"+"<hr>")
             i++
         }

            3. DO WHILE

            let i=6
            do {
                document.write("TOPS"+"<hr>")
                i++
            } while (i<5);
    </script>


11.What is the function of the delete operator?
Ans.The delete operator deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.

Expressions - delete operator

    const Employee = {
    firstname: 'John',
    lastname: 'Doe',
 };

  console.log(Employee.firstname);
  // Expected output: "John"
