• What is Redux?

 ->Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write
 JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client,server, and native
 environments, and are easy to test.

 ->It’s mostly used as a state-management tool with React. you can also
  use it with other JavaScript frameworks or libraries.

  ->It’s lightweight so you don’t need to worry about App size.

  ->When your project grows to the scale where managing app state
  becomes trouble, you can use redux to simplify the process of state
  management of state.



• What is Redux Thunk used for?

 ->Redux thunk is a middleware and the middleware functions run between
dispatching an action and reducer. It is used for logging, routing, and
asynchronous action.


->It allows us to return a function instead of an object from the actions, only
redux doesn't allow us to perform complex logic inside action functions.


Thunk allows us to run some asynchronous code before dispatching the
action function.



• What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component
overComponent?


React Pure components are the components that don't re-renders when
states and props value are updated with the same values. So,these
components do not cause re-rendering to improve performance.

When we don’t need our child component to re-rendered when its parent
component re-renders we use Pure Component.



• What is the second argument that can optionally be
passedtosetState and what is its purpose?

The second argument that can optionally be passed to setState is
callback function which gets called immediately after the setState is
completed and the components get re-rendered.

If we want our program to perform certain actions on updated state after
setting the setState value for that we must have to specify those actions in
callback function or we can say function as a second argument to the
setState. If we don’t do that, actions will be performed on the previous
value of the state because of the asynchronous nature of setState.
